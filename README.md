# Interactive-Diversity-Visualization
An interactive visualization of tech industry diversity data

#### Setting Up

This app requires Bokeh and Pandas to be installed. From the
command line, execute:

    pip install -r requirements.txt
    
or:

    pip install bokeh

and

    pip install pandas

#### Running

To run the app, navigate to the Interactive-Diversity-Visualization directory and execute the command:

    bokeh serve --show diversity

(Windows used can just execute run.bat)

#### Issues

The database that I pulled this data from (https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1e5jevLJTK9Aayob2msk4Ss9qIMCqfris4m_m0kXO-7s/edit#gid=1925490147) contains duplicate data for some companies.

#### To Do
- Verify current data set
